This is my go lang tutorial

First you need to install go (https://go.dev/)
I am using VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/)
After installing VSCode install go extension (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.go)

The package fmt documentation for printing
https://pkg.go.dev/fmt

Sample Demos are placed on directories:
